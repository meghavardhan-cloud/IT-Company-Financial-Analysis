📊 Comparative Financial Analysis of Indian IT Companies (FY2021–FY2025)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comparative financial analysis of three Indian IT companies representing different market capitalisation segments:

Infosys Limited – Large-cap

Coforge Limited – Mid-cap

Dynacons Systems & Solutions Limited – Small-cap

The objective of the study is to understand how scale, growth intensity, profitability, capital efficiency, and disclosure quality differ across companies operating in the same sector but at different stages of maturity.

The analysis covers a five-year period (FY2021–FY2025) and is based entirely on consolidated financial data sourced from official annual reports.

🎯 Objectives of the Project

Compare financial performance across large-, mid-, and small-cap IT companies

Analyze revenue, operating profit, and net profit trends

Evaluate growth using both absolute values and indexed analysis (FY2021 = 100)

Assess efficiency and return ratios such as ROE and ROCE

Examine how disclosure quality impacts investor interpretation

Identify structural strengths and limitations across companies

📂 Data Sources

Official Annual Reports of Infosys, Coforge, and Dynacons

Only consolidated financial statements were used

No third-party financial websites were relied upon for ratios

All ratios were manually calculated using standard financial formulas

⚠️ Certain operational indicators (e.g., employee headcount, R&D details) were excluded due to non-uniform disclosure across companies, particularly for Dynacons.

🧮 Methodology

The project uses a structured analytical approach:

1. Financial Analysis (Absolute Values)

Revenue

Operating Profit

Net Profit

EPS

Used to compare scale and magnitude across companies.

2. Indexed Growth Analysis

Revenue Index (FY2021 = 100)

Net Profit Index (FY2021 = 100)

Used to compare growth intensity independent of company size.

3. Ratio Analysis

Calculated manually:

Operating Margin

Net Profit Margin

Return on Equity (ROE)

Return on Capital Employed (ROCE – using average capital employed)

Earnings Per Share (EPS – Basic)

Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

4. Visualization

Microsoft Excel used for:

Data structuring

Pivot tables

Charts (absolute vs indexed comparisons)

🧠 Key Insights

High indexed growth does not imply financial strength when base values are small

Dynacons shows strong growth momentum but faces structural scalability constraints

Coforge, despite being mid-cap, operates closer to small-cap performance levels than expected

Infosys demonstrates scale-driven stability, efficiency, and reinvestment capacity

Disclosure quality matters: clearer presentation improves investor confidence and comparability

The analysis emphasizes that growth, efficiency, and transparency must be evaluated together, not in isolation.

⚠️ Limitations

Analysis is based on historical financial data only

Market sentiment and macroeconomic factors are not modeled

Certain operational metrics were excluded due to disclosure gaps

Findings are analytical, not investment advice

🛠 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (Data analysis & dashboards)

Git & GitHub (Version control and project hosting
📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates that meaningful financial analysis goes beyond surface-level comparisons. By combining absolute performance, indexed growth, efficiency ratios, and disclosure quality, the study provides a holistic view of how IT companies evolve across different market capitalisation segments.
